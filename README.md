Tile sprite
=================

Small tool to generate sprite

Images must follow this naming: `<group>-<comment>-<col>-<row>.(png|jpg|gif)`

## Execution
Copy your images in a directory and run:
```
node tilize.js path-to-images-directory file-to-write.png
```

if you do not specify a file to write, it will put it in `out/image-directory-name.png` by default
